## :ocean: Keep it on the Loudoun :ocean:
- After looking at benthic macroinvertebrate health it became apparent that Loudoun County in Virginia had conisistently poor ratings over time and continues to decline in quality. 
- Research revealed that Loudoun is one of the 20 fastest growing counties in the U.S. and its population continues to increase - which impacts stream and river health that directly flows towards the D.C. area

- How variable is the indicator(s) across seasons?
- What is the rate of change you are seeing?
- How does the pace of change at your area(s) of interest compare to our understanding of your chosen indicator change in the watershed? In those specific regions of the watershed?
- (If one of your indicators is pH): Do any locations indicate restoration success (i.e., trending towards neutral) or new degrading trends (either becoming very low (<5) or very high (>9))?
- From your research (the provided background reading and/or additional external research on your selected region), how would you expect external factors and/or water management practices to impact this indicator? Do we see this reflected in the data?
- How does CMCâ€™s data change or support the story, compared to an analysis on CBP data alone?

## :droplet: Target Deliverables :droplet:

- Visualization(s) that tell a story about water quality and surrounding land use over time
- An explanation of methods for developing your analysis
