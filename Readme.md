## :ocean: Guiding Questions :ocean:

- How does land cover, land use, and/or geology describe the selected region? ​
- How does weather impact water flow into the Bay?​
- Can you separate the influence of source and point source pollution for a selected region of the watershed?​
- How does using CMC’s data in an analysis of pollution patterns and indicator results impact our understanding of pollution sources and their effects on water quality (compared to an analysis on CBP data alone?)

## :droplet: Target Deliverables :droplet:

- Predictive model and/or correlation analysis for explaining patterns found from condition measures expressed by water quality indicator(s) assessments in a part or all of the watershed​. (For machine learning solutions, include your model's performance metrics and your interpretation.)
- Visualizations and code to support your model and analytical process/findings
